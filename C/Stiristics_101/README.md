# C: Stiristics 101

Learn basic mechanics of C by example.

## Lesson 1: "Hello, World!"

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}
```

Since we are going to print something, we would need to include the library which has standard input and output, namely `stdio.h`.

To do this, we put `#include <stdio.h>` in the first line, as shown above.

The thing that we want the program to perform upon execution is inside the function `main` as shown above. The `int` in `int main()` means that this function will return an integer value. This is because it returns `0` for no error or `1` for error. This function also takes no arguments, hence the emptiness inside the parentheses.

Inside the function, we would print the string `"Hello, World!"` as shown: `printf("Hello, World!");`. The semicolon is used to indicate that the statement has ended.

Then, we `return 0`, indicating that this was a successful execution.
